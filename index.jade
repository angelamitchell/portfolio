            h2 Your Next Confidently Humble UX Designer
            p.large.intro I love creating and am passionate about user experience design. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve come to believe that design should be visually pleasing and functional to meet the needs of the user. The best solutions start with great communication, teamwork and iteration. What I value most in the workplace is a positive environment with individuals who are passionate about creating the best end product for the user.

                p I work best with individuals who are excited about the work they create. It is important that my team feel empowered and encouraged when working on any project.
                p I was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida and graduated from UNF in 2010. I come from a pretty large family - three brothers and three sisters. I now have my own family and together we have adopted three persian cats. We have even started an #[a(href='http://www.instagram.com/persiansrightmeow' target='_blank') instagram] account documenting their lives.
                p Along with my love for cats is my love for art and design. I learned to draw cartoons at a young age. This determination to learn and succeed carried into my adult life. I am the dedicated and hard worker I am because of those earlier years.
