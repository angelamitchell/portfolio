            h2 Process
            p Initially, meetings were set to discuss requirements and deadlines. At the time of this project, the brand was evolving and I took iniative to include the new elements from the evolved  brand. This included a wider grid, different font treatments and an added card functionality.
            p A content developer and I collaborated on the initial designs. We discussed different strategies for the landing page that I quickly sketched out. After presenting the findings to the business I proceeded to create low and high fidelty prototypes. 
            p These prototypes were presented to the business and after making changes I moved into building out the new page.
            p The landing page originally had three offers, but I designed it in a way that would allow for more offers to be added in the future. I was able to arrive at a solution which exceeded the client's expectation through allowing them to easily review the content and decide on an offer.
            h3 The Build
            p The page was built in GitHub using HTML, SASS and JavaScript before being moved into Sitecore.
