            h1 Your next confidently humble UI/UX designer
            p.large.intro I was so excited to hear about an opening for a UI/UX Designer at YNAB. Now this is what I've been looking for in my career - a place that is making a difference in people's lives! Your company manifesto helped me realize what I value in the workplace. I want to work with a team who is as passionate about UI/UX design as I am. A team that wants to create the best experience for the user.

              p I was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida and graduated from UNF in 2010. I come from a pretty large family - three brothers and three sisters. I now have my own family and together we have adopted three persian cats. We have even started an #[a(href='http://www.instagram.com/persiansrightmeow' target='_blank') instagram] account documenting their lives.
              p Along with my love for cats is my love for art and design. I learned to draw cartoons at a young age. This determination to learn and succeed carried into my adult life. I am a dedicated and hard worker because of those earlier years.

                p What is most important to me is a positive team environment. Simple words of kindness go a long way. I work best when everyone on the team works well together. There is always room for growth no matter how talented you are.
