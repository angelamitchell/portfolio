            h1 A Passionate and Confident UI/UX Designer
            p.large.intro I value working in a positive environment where individuals are making a difference in other peopleâ€™s lives. I can work independently, but I also enjoy collaborating with a team to fully understand what the user is thinking, feeling, and their interaction with the design.

              p I was born and raised in Jacksonville, Florida and graduated from UNF in 2010. I come from a pretty large family - three brothers and three sisters. I now have my own family and together we have adopted three persian cats. We have even started an #[a(href='http://www.instagram.com/persiansrightmeow' target='_blank') instagram] account documenting their lives.
              p Along with my love for cats is my love for art and design. I learned to draw cartoons at a young age. This determination to learn and succeed carried into my adult life. I am a dedicated and hard worker because of those earlier years.

                p What is most important to me is a positive team environment. Simple words of kindness go a long way. I work best when everyone on the team works well together. There is always room for growth no matter how talented you are.
